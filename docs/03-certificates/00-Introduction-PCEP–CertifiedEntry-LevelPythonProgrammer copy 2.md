- Functions
    - A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
    - You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
    - A function can return data as a result.
    - To call a function, use the function name followed by parenthesis.
    - Information can be passed into functions as arguments.
    - Arguments are specified after the function name, inside the parentheses. You can add as many arguments as you want, just separate them with a comma.
    - A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.
    - An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called.
        - Arguments are often shortened to args in Python documentations.
    - But they both can be used to represent the idea of `information that are passed into a function`.
    ```python title="Criação de função, usando Python"
    def my_function(parameter1):
        print("Hello from a function" + parameter1)
        
    my_function(argumentSentInTheFunctionCall)
    ```  
    - By default, a function must be called with the correct number of arguments. Meaning that if your function expects 2 arguments, you have to call the function with 2 arguments, not more, and not less.
    - If you don't want to define how many arguments that will be passed into your function; add a * before the parameter name in the function definition. This way the function will receive a tuple of arguments, and can access the items accordingly.  
    ```python title="tuple as function call argument"
    def my_function(*kids):
        print("The youngest child is " + kids[2])
        
    my_function("Emil", "Tobias", "Linus")
    ``` 
    - Arbitrary Arguments are often shortened to *args in Python documentations.  
    - You can also send arguments with the key = value syntax. (keyword arguments).
        - This way the order of the arguments does not matter.
        ```python title="Keyword arguments"
        def my_function(child3, child2, child1):
            print("The youngest child is " + child3)
            
        my_function(child1 = "Emil", child2 = "Tobias", child3 = "Linus")  
        ```  
    - The phrase Keyword Arguments are often shortened to kwargs in Python documentations.
    - Arbitrary Keyword Arguments, **kwargs
    - If you don't want to define how many keyword arguments that will be passed into your function, add two asterisk: ** before the parameter name in the function definition. This way the function will receive a dictionary of arguments, and can access the items accordingly:
    ```python title="Arbitrary Keyword Arguments"
    def my_function(**kid):
        print("His last name is " + kid["lname"])
        
    my_function(fname = "Tobias", lname = "Refsnes")  
    ```  
    - Arbitrary Kword Arguments are often shortened to **kwargs in Python documentations.
    - If we call the function without argument, it uses the "Default Parameter Value".
    ```python title="Default Parameter Value"
    def my_function(country = "Norway"):
        print("I am from " + country)
        
    my_function("Sweden")
    my_function("India")
    my_function()
    my_function("Brazil")  
    ```  
    - You can send any data types of argument to a function (string, number, list, dictionary etc.), and it will be treated as the same data type inside the function.
    - To let a function return a value, use the return statement
    ```python title="Return values"
    def my_function(x):
        return 5 * x
        
    print(my_function(3))
    print(my_function(5))
    print(my_function(9))  
    ```  
    - The pass Statement
        - Function definitions cannot be empty, but if you use the pass statement, you avoid getting an error.  
        ```python title="Pass statement"
        def myfunction():
            pass
        ```  
    - Python also accepts function recursion, which means a defined function can call itself.  
        - Recursion is a common mathematical and programming concept. It means that a function calls itself. This has the benefit of meaning that you can loop through data to reach a result.
        - The developer should be very careful with recursion as it can be quite easy to slip into writing a function which never terminates, or one that uses excess amounts of memory or processor power. However, when written correctly recursion can be a very efficient and mathematically-elegant approach to programming.
        = In this example, tri_recursion() is a function that we have defined to call itself ("recurse"). We use the k variable as the data, which decrements (-1) every time we recurse. The recursion ends when the condition is not greater than 0 (i.e. when it is 0).
    ```python title="Recursion"
    def tri_recursion(k):
        if(k > 0):
            result = k + tri_recursion(k - 1)
            print(result)
        else:
            result = 0
        return result
        
    print("\n\nRecursion Example Results")
    tri_recursion(6)  
    ```  
- Conditions
    - Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
        - Equals: a == b
        - Not Equals: a != b
        - Less than: a < b
        - Less than or equal to: a <= b
        - Greater than: a > b
        - Greater than or equal to: a >= b
        - These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
    - An "if statement" is written by using the if keyword.
    ```python title="if statement"
    a = 33
    b = 200
    if b > a:
        print("b is greater than a")
    ```  
    - elif keyword
        - The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".
        ```python title="elif keyword"
        a = 33
        b = 33
        if b > a:
            print("b is greater than a")
        elif a == b:
            print("a and b are equal")
        ```  
    - else keyword
        - The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
        ```python title="else keyword"
        a = 200
        b = 33
        if b > a:
            print("b is greater than a")
        elif a == b:
            print("a and b are equal")
        else:
            print("a is greater than b")
        ```  
    - If you have only one statement to execute, you can put it on the same line as the if statement.
    ```python title="short if statement"
    if a > b: print("a is greater than b")
    ```  
    - If you have only one statement to execute, one for if, and one for else, you can put it all on the same line:  
    ```python title="short if-else statement"
    a = 2
    b = 330
    print("A") if a > b else print("B")
    ```  
    - Technique known as Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions:
        - One line if else statement, with 3 conditions.
        - Instruction code is written before the loginal operator.
        ```python title="Ternary Operators, or Conditional Expressions"
        a = 330
        b = 330
        print("A") if a > b else print("=") if a == b else print("B")
        ```  
    - And keyword
        - The and keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
        ```python title="and kwyword"
        a = 200
        b = 33
        c = 500
        if a > b and c > a:
            print("Both conditions are True")
        ```  
    - Or keyword
        - The or keyword is a logical operator, and is used to combine conditional statements:
        ```python title="or keyword"
        a = 200
        b = 33
        c = 500
        if a > b or c > a:
            print("At least one of the conditions is True")
        ```  
    - Not keyword
        - The not keyword is a logical operator, and is used to reverse the result of the conditional statement:
        ```python title="or keyword"
        a = 33
        b = 200
        if not a > b:
            print("a is NOT greater than b")
        ```  
    - Nested If
        - You can have if statements inside if statements, this is called nested if statements.
        ```python title="Nested if"
        x = 41
        if x > 10:
            print("Above ten,")
            if x > 20:
                print("and also above 20!")
            else:
                print("but not above 20.")
        ```  
    - The pass Statement
        - if statements cannot be empty, but if you for some reason have an if statement with no content, put in the pass statement to avoid getting an error.  
        ```python title="pass statement"
        a = 33
        b = 200
        if b > a:
            pass
        ```  
- Loops
    - Python has two primitive loop commands:
        - while loops
            - With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
            ```python title="while loop"
            i = 1
            while i < 6:
                print(i)
                i += 1
            ```  
            - With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:
            ```python title="while loop with break statement"
            i = 1
            while i < 6:
                print(i)
                if i == 3:
                    break
                i += 1
            ```  
        - for loops
            - A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).
            - This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.
            - With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
            ```python title="for loop"
            fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
            for x in fruits:
                print(x)
            ```  
            - The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.
            - Even strings are iterable objects, they contain a sequence of characters
            - With the break statement we can stop the loop before it has looped through all the items:
            ```python title="for loop with break statement"
            for x in "bananaZ":
                if x == "Z":
                    break
                print(x)
                ```  

- syntax
    - Python uses **new lines to complete a command**, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.
    - Python Indentation
        - Python **relies on indentation, using whitespace, to define scope, such as the scope of loops, functions and classes**. Other programming languages often use curly-brackets for this purpose.
        - Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line.
        - Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
        - The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, the most common use is four, but it has to be at least one.
        - You have to use the same number of spaces in the same block of code, otherwise Python will give you an error.
    - Python Variables
        - In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it.
        - Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    - Comments
        - Python has commenting capability for the purpose of in-code documentation.
        - Comments start with a #, and Python will render the rest of the line as a comment:
- semantics
- runtime environment
