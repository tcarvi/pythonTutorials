# Python Program Execution

- Execution by writing directly in the Python Command Line:
```console title="python script"
python -c "print('some Python script...') "
```  
  
- Execution by calling a source file of a Python program:
```console title="source file of a Python program"
python [filename].py
```  

- Execution by using a default IDLE:
```console title="Integrated Development and Learning Environment"
idle
```
